### Here is a little bit about me:)

My name is Maya Kurani, and I am a fourth-year Economics and Environmental Studies major at UCSB! Driven by a deep passion for the environment, I have found my purpose studying environmental justice and sustainability management.

Throughout the years, I have explored the fundamental connection between sustainability and health equityâ€” clean air, water, and good waste management practices are essential to a healthy community. Due to previous experiences, I have learned that I want to go into environmental consulting in order to change business practices and implement lasting systemic change.

I also love  capturing the beauty of nature through photography, and am committed to reducing waste and toxins to protect our precious environment. Next year, I am going to the Bren School to get my Masters in Environmental Management, and I am so excited!
