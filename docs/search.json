    "text": "Here is a little bit about me:)\nMy name is Maya Kurani, and I am a fourth-year Economics and Environmental Studies major at UCSB! Driven by a deep passion for the environment, I have found my purpose studying environmental justice and sustainability management.\nThroughout the years, I have explored the fundamental connection between sustainability and health equity— clean air, water, and good waste management practices are essential to a healthy community. Due to previous experiences, I have learned that I want to go into environmental consulting in order to change business practices and implement lasting systemic change.\nI also love capturing the beauty of nature through photography, and am committed to reducing waste and toxins to protect our precious environment. Next year, I am going to the Bren School to get my Masters in Environmental Management, and I am so excited!"
